# Homework 2 - CS 316 01 FA22 Assignments

**Binary Trees**

this assignment focuses on the recursive algorithms for traversing a binary tree

---

## Problem 1

> Create all 6 depth first traversal algorithms

The source code files for problem 1 are located in binTree/java and can
be quickly compiled and run on a unix system containing make by running
make run

sample outputs can be found in output_screenshot.png
